Instructions for running AE-DeepONet: This framework requires the code to be run in three stages. 

1) First run the train_AE.py. This will run the autoencoder, and save the AE model with the lowest test error.
2) Next run generate_ld_dataset.py. This will use the saved AE model to generate the latent dimension of all the training and test samples.
3) The dataset generated in step 2 would be used to train the DeepONet.
4) To train the DeepONet, run train_DON.py.

The datasets preprocessing for both AE and DON are preprocessed in the file Dataset.py.

The data folder has 2 mat files, one for training and the other for testing. 
'f_train', and f_test of these two files are used to train and test the autoencoder. However, while training the autoencoder the initial conditions (initial temperature and the equivalence ratio) are separated. Only the mass fractions are trained.
Once the autoencoder is trained, the initial conditions are concatenated to the latent dimension in the "generate_ld_dataset.py" script.
The integrated dataset is then used to train the DeepONet. 

In the script train_DON.py, we compute the accuracy of the entire framework: initial condition mapped to the 1000th time step for data from the testing_data_ds.mat, using the AE +DeepONet, and report it.
