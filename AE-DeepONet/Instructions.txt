Instructions for running AE-DeepONet: This framework requires the code to be run in three stages. 

1) First run the train_AE.py. This will run the autoencoder, and save the AE model with the lowest test error.
2) Next run generate_ld_dataset.py. This will use the saved AE model to generate the latent dimension of all the training and test samples.
3) The dataset generated in step 2 would be used to train the DeepONet.
4) To train the DeepONet, run train_DON.py.

The datasets preprocessing for both AE and DON are preprocessed in the file Dataset.py.

In the data folder:
"DataLog_ae_training.mat": This is for training the AE. Each timestep of each sample is considered a single entity.
When training the DeepONet, we arrange the data in 250th, 500th, 750th, and 1000th steps. The training dataset for DeepONet training is "training_data_temp_eqr_log". Once the AE is training, the "training_data_temp_eqr_log.mat" is called in the "generate_ld_dataset.py" to obtain the latent dimension of the training data for DeepONet.
